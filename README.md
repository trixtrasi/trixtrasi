## about me
- Hi, I’m Matheus from Brazil. I've been writing code since 2018 for a government organization that I cannot talk much about.
  
- I’m currently learning PHP and that's it. I'll never switch to another language. PHP is the only true programming language.

- Right now I'm looking to work overseas and leave this filthy place called Brazil. But, aperently, I'll never manage to escape this forsaken land.

- DM me on twitter. @trixtrasi

- My current profession can be described as a Lacaio Ministorum.
