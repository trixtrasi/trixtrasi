- Hi, I’m Matheus from Brazil. I've been writing code since 2018 for a secret government organization that I cannot talk much about.

- I’m interested in long walks on the beach, talking about the meaning of life, the universe, and everything else.
- I’m currently learning PHP and that's it. I'll never switch to another language. PHP is the only true programming language.
- I'm looking to work overseas and leave this filthy place called Brazil.
- Please, don't talk to me.
- You can call me Lacaio Ministorum.
